# Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers some questions that we frequently receive about the curriculum.
If you have questions that aren't answered here, try asking through one of our [community channels](README.md#community).
If it seems important enough or we get asked that question a lot, we will probably add it here.

Alternatively, you could [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) an answer yourself.

## Questions

### Does OSSU offer a degree?
No. OSSU creates guides to resources that will empower you to learn the curriculum of an undergraduate degree. Individuals who used to be involved in OSSU may be working with other organizations to offer degrees, but Open Source Society University is not involved in those efforts.

### Why is the Firebase OSSU app different or broken?

The OSSU curriculum and ecosystem have been collaboratively built by many individuals. The Firebase app was one such contribution. When it was written, it was with the intention of helping future OSSU students.

Unfortunately, the app has not been updated in many years. It does not reflect updates to the curriculum, it contains links to courses that no longer exist, and it has known bugs that prevent students from logging in.

It is our hope that the creators of the Firebase app can bring the app up to date. Until that time, the firebase app should be considered a deprecated product that is no longer supported.

### In what order should I take the courses?

Each course has a prerequisite of the previous course, so you should take the cources linearly from top to bottom.

### Does every resource in the main curriculum have to be free?

Yes, that is a core goal of OSSU.

At the same time, we recognize that education is a resource that requires payment to instructors to make it sustainable in the long term.
Therefore, we respect the business model of websites like edX, which make their materials free but with some paid add-ons, like official certificates or extra interaction with course instructors.

So we only require that the *learning materials* of a resource be free to access, not that every possible add-on be free.
It would be ideal if graded assignments were always free. In the event that free assessments are not available OSSU looks for alternate assessments to pair with a course.

### Are Coursera courses free to access?

Some courses that require payment to access probably do exist on Coursera, but we don't put those on our curriculum.
All Coursera courses that we put on the curriculum must, at minimum, be **free to audit**.
For some courses, all course features are available for free;
for others (especially those that are part of a specialization), you may only be able to access the lecture videos.
(If you find the policies have changed for any courses on our curriculum, please tell us!)

Unfortunately, for some courses, Coursera's interface is [very aggressive](https://www.deceptive.design/) about convincing you that you have to pay.

You may see something like this on the course page:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MxOcYZv.png" alt="Free Trial" style="width: 400px;"/>

When attempting to enroll in such a course:
- Click the blue "Enroll" or "Enroll Now" button.
- A pop-up will appear.
- **Do not click** "Start Free Trial", unless you do want to pay.
- Find the text that says "Audit this course" at the bottom.
- Click **Audit**.

### Is it necessary to purchase the Verified Upgrade for edX courses?

If you just want to watch the videos, it is never necessary for any edX course on our curriculum. Note that a number of edX courses only allow students to audit a course for the estimated number of weeks it takes to complete. Students should not begin a course until they are prepared to focus and complete the course.

### What are the alt links?

Sometimes a course is on multiple platforms that are reasonably similar in quality so we have an alt or two linked in case the main one isn't being offered at the time or you prefer the other one. Both are just as good, go with whichever you prefer or whichever is available when you want to take the course.

### Why doesn't the curriculum cover/ignore topic X?

You can read more about our curricular guidelines and the qualifications of the guidelines' authors [here](CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md). If you find a topic that is required by our guidelines and is not included in the curriculum, we should make a change! Read more about [contributing to a change](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### How can I find a course on a particular subject?
For MOOCs an excellent resource is [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com/).
For materials from university courses that are online (but not organized)
into a MOOC, [awesome-courses](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses) and
[cs-video-courses](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses)
are good resources. For textbooks, [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/genres/computer-science)
is a great platform for reader ratings and reviews.
For learning a particular programming language or framework,
[see this question](#what-is-a-good-course-to-learn-a-particular-language).

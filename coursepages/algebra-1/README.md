This course was created by [The College Prep School](https://www.youtube.com/@thecollegeprepschool4486). The entirety of this course is contained in the following YouTube playlist, including all of your homework and tests. Note that "Algebra 1" and "Beginning Algebra" are the same thing.

## Instructions:

- Work through the playlist from top to bottom.
- In each video, the teacher works through a problem set, then a homework.
- When the teacher says "try this one on your own", pause the video and work it out. You do not have to do every single problem, but make sure to pay attention, learn the method to solve it, and do the ones he tells you to complete.
- Always complete the homework. If you get something wrong according to the answer key, try to see what you did wrong and redo the problem correctly.
- When you get to a review day, attempt every problem yourself then complete the homework.
- Take the tests seriously and don't cheat. Use them as a measure to see where your knowlege is at. Do not move on without feeling proficient at a topic.
- You may find a calculator useful for this course. [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) is a good free graphing calculator.

## Notes:

- Class 4, questions 47-59: For factoring equations such as $$Ax^2 + Bx + C$$ where $A \neq 1$, an easier method for solving these problems is the X method(AKA the diamond method), as seen in [this clip](https://youtu.be/u2CFHYJWS60?t=1590) from Professor Leonard.
